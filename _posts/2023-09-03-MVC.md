We already kow how to find area under curve (definite integral), but what about for other function types?

- *Intuition*: example, $f(x,y)=x y, x = g(t), y = h(t) \text{, for } a\leq t \leq b$
	- Intuitively, change in ds (super small arc length change) gets a rectangle / area using f(x,y)
	- Think of hte integral as the wall long curve up to the surface
	- Thus its the integral of f(x,y)s over time period t = a to t = b
	- $ds = \sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2}$  since ds is the arc length
	- SO, we can represent the integral as 
		- $\int ^{t=b}_{t=a} f(x,y) \sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2}$  Since we’re integrating as a function of t, we should write f in terms of t
		- Can mutliply the square root by $\frac{dt}{dt}$
		- Thus, the integral becomes $\int ^{t=b}_{t=a} f(x,y) \sqrt{\frac{\partial x}{dt}^2+ \frac{\partial y}{dt}^2}$ dt 
			- First term = the height- secon term, the changing arc
#### ***Formula for line integral***
-  $\int ^{t=b}_{t=a} f(x,y) \sqrt{\frac{\partial x}{dt}^2+ \frac{\partial y}{dt}^2}$
- Given a scalar field $f$, parameterization $\alpha$, and bounds $t_0$ and $t_1$, we can calculate the line entegral as follows:

> Equation for line integral: $\int _C f ds=\int _{t_0}^{t_1}f(\alpha (t))\text{ }\lvert \lvert alpha'(t)\rvert \rvert ds$

# **Line Integrals in Vector Fields**
Take a vector field F an a curve C wondering through the vector field.
- Walk along the curve an at each step take the dot pooduct between
	- vector from the field F where you’re standing
	- displacement vetor assoicated with the next step you take along the curve
- This is the line integral of F along C
	- Shorthand: $\int_c F \cdot dr$ 
	- More explicit notation: given a parameterization  $r(t)$ of $C$,
		- $\int_a^b F(r(t)) \cdot r'(t) dt$ 
	- Breaking it down
		- $F$ the vector (force) field
		- $C$ curve through space
		- $r(t)$ vector-valued function parameterizing the curve $C$ in the range a ≤ t ≤ b
		- $r’(t)$ is the derivative of $r$, which represents the velocity vector of a particle whose position is given by $r(t)$ while $t$ increases at a constant rate
		- Think of $F(r(t)) \cdot r'(t) dr$ as $dW$- a tiny amount of work done by the rofrce field $F$ on a particle moving along C
- Useful for: computing the work done by a force on a moving object
- Difference between this an dline integration in a scalar field
	- Tiny step ds is now thought of as a vector, now a scale length
