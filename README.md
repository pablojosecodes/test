I'm an SF-native currently putting [my](https://pablohansengrowth.substack.com/) [thoughts](https://ambition.pablohansen.com/) [online](https://creative.pablohansen.com/) as I run a consulting company and a product studio.
 
I previously worked at a stealth startup and am finishing up a Master's in AI.

If you are a creator looking to grow your audience, I <a target="_blank" href="https://creative.pablohansen.com/">write a weekly deep dive for you</a>.

If you are interested in how successful startups scale from an organizational and software arhitecture persective, I <a target="_blank" href="https://ambition.pablohansen.com/">write The Architecter for you</a>.
